=head1 NOTE

When this module was first created in November 2014, we belatedly realized
that there was already an Inline::Module on CPAN, by Ingy. The other one is to
"inline" one module inside another. It appears that nobody uses the old one,
but if that is not the case, contact INGY and he'll redo that one under
another name.
