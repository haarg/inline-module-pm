=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your module (say C<Acme::Math::XS>):

    use Acme::Math::XS::Inline C =>
      "long add(long a, long b) { return a + b; }";

In C<Makefile.PL>:

    use lib 'inc';
    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
    use Inline::Module;

    WriteMakefile(
      NAME => 'Acme::Math::XS',
      postamble => {
        inline => {
          module => 'Acme::Math::XS',
        },
      },
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides support and documentation for creating and maintaining
CPAN extension modules. ie Writing XS modules without having to learn XS.

The L<Inline::Module::Tutorial> explains the simple processes involved.

When used from a C<Makefile.PL>, this module provides support for modifying
the Makefile generated by L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>.

You just need to provide a C<postamble> section. See below.

You also need to make sure that the C<inc/> directory is in C<@INC>. This is
where the build tools will be when your module is shipped to CPAN.

=head2 postamble Section

Arguments are key/value pairs.

=over

=item C<module>

    module => 'My::Module',

Required. This is the module that contains inline C<C> or C<C++> code. It can
be an array ref of multiple modules.

=item C<stub>

    stub => 'My::Module::Inline',

Optional. This is the name of the Inline::Module generated stub module. It's
value defaults to the C<module> argument with '::Inline' appended. It can be
an array ref of multiple modules.

=item C<ilsm>

    ilsm => 'Inline::CPP',

Optional. This is the Inline Language Support Module (ilsm) that you are
using. It defaults to L<Inline::C>. It can be an array ref of multiple ilsm-s.

=head1 STUB MODULE GENERATION

During development, L<Inline::Module> needs to generate I<stub> modules. For
the case in the synopsis, it would need to generate C<Acme::Math::XS::Inline>.
There a few similar but different ways to do this:

    perl -MInline::Module=makestub,Acme::Math::XS::Inline

or:

    export PERL5OPT='-MInline::Module=autostub'
    prove -lv t/

or:

    perl Makefile.PL

=head1 TPF GRANT

This module was written as the major portion of the work for a 2014 Perl
Foundation grant:

L<http://news.perlfoundation.org/2014/09/grant-proposal-inlinecpp-modul.html>

=head1 NOTE

When this module was first created in November 2014, we belatedly realized
that there was already an Inline::Module on CPAN, by Ingy. The other one is to
"inline" one module inside another. It appears that nobody uses the old one,
but if that is not the case, contact INGY and he'll redo that one under
another name.
