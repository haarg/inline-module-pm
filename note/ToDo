== To Do Next

- Update MANIFEST file with inc/ stuff

- Add new plugin sections to the tutorial

- Refactor Dist-Zilla-Plugin-InlineModule to use postamble
  - and Alt-Acme-Math-XS-DistZilla
  - Look at ZillaDist too

- Write tests for dist operations

- Find out why `make test` invokes Inline::Module in a distdir
  - Only `make` should do that

- Disable autostub when inc/ exists (ie during distdir time)

== Soon

- Check VERSION in XS
  - Add VERSION stuff into generated XS

- Add tests
  + Bash test setup
  - Write a test/devel test for making a full module like Acme::Math::XS

- Think of a way to make sure Inline::Module version does not regress.
  - From release to release with comaintainers
  - Not sure how important this is

== Done

+ Switch Inline::Module to the postamble model
  + Release new acme-math-xs
  + Release new inline-module
  + Fix Tutorial for postamble
+ Write Module::Install::InlineModule
  + and Alt-Acme-Math-XS-ModuleInstall
+ Write weekend blog post (#5)
+ Get rid of `perl-inline-module` bin script (probably)
  + The ::Inline module can be generated by the Makefile.PL etc
  + It should likely never be committed. (We commit it now)
+ Change 'inline' config key to 'stub'
+ Use IO::String for autostub handle by default
+ Try putting ::Inline module into author time blib
  + This would simplify everything greatly
+ Change the 'inline' meta keyword to 'loader' or 'stub'
  + This might go away altogether so let's wait and see
+ Issue #9. Fix this `make` time bug:
    > make
    Can't opendir(blib/lib/auto/Alt): No such file or directory
    at inc/Inline/Module.pm line 227.
