+ Switch Inline::Module to the postamble model
  + Release new acme-math-xs
  + Release new inline-module
  + Fix Tutorial for postamble
  - Add a test or two
+ Write Module::Install::InlineModule
  + and Alt-Acme-Math-XS-ModuleInstall
- Refactor Dist-Zilla-Plugin-InlineModule to use postamble
  - and Alt-Acme-Math-XS-DistZilla
  - Look at ZillaDist too
- Write weekend blog post (#5)


== Cards

- Add new plugin sections to the tutorial

- Try putting ::Inline module into author time blib
  - This would simplify everything greatly

- Fix this `make` time bug:
    > make
    Can't opendir(blib/lib/auto/Alt): No such file or directory
    at inc/Inline/Module.pm line 227.
  - Happens on:
    - make
    - make test
    - make install

- Get rid of `perl-inline-module` bin script (probably)
  - The ::Inline module can be generated by the Makefile.PL etc
  - It should likely never be committed. (We commit it now)

- Think of a way to make sure Inline::Module version does not regress.
  - From release to release with comaintainers
  - Not sure how important this is

- Change the 'inline' meta keyword to 'loader' or 'stub'

- Write a test/devel test for making a full module like Acme::Math::XS
